# i18n-ai

i18n-ai is a gem that converts your rails locales into different languages automatically. Uses the `en.yml` file as base by default and creates accompanying `es.yml`, `it.yml` and others depending on your configuration.

Currently uses OpenAI (`gpt4o-mini`) to generate the translations but support for other AI models and APIs will be added soon.

## Installation

Simply add to your gemfile:

```
gem "i18n-ai"
```

And do `bundle install`.

## Configuration

To use I18nAi, you need to set the appropriate environment variables based on the AI service you wish to use.

### OpenAi

If you are using OpenAI, set `ENV["OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN"]`

To configure and enable other locales, create a file `config/initializers/i18n_ai.rb` and add the following:

```
# config/initializers/i18n_ai.rb
I18nAi.configure do |config|
  config.ai_settings = {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    access_token: ENV["OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN"]
  }
  config.generate_locales = [:es, :it] # add your other supported locales to this array
end
```

### Anthropic's Claude

If you prefer to use Anthropic's Claude, set `ENV[ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]`

To configure and enable other locales, create a file `config/initializers/i18n_ai.rb` and add the following:

```
I18nAi.configure do |config|
  config.ai_settings = {
    provider: "anthropic",
    model: "claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    access_token: ENV["ANTHROPIC_ACCESS_TOKEN"]
  }
  config.generate_locales = [:es]
end
```

### Local

You can also use local AI models that use the OpenAI API. Also make sure to use the completions API endpoint as the url vs the chat API endpoint.

Tested locally with ollama with mistral and llama3.

To configure and enable other locales, create a file `config/initializers/i18n_ai.rb`
and add the following:

```
I18nAi.configure do |config|
  config.ai_settings = {
    provider: "local",
    model: "mistral",
    url: "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
  }
  config.generate_locales = [:es]
end
```

## Usage

Every page reload, the gem will check if the `en.yml` file changed and if it did, it will automatically generate the configured locale files.

The gem has been setup to generate a `es.yml` file by default.

To disable locale generation simply set the `generate_locales` to an empty array.

```
I18nAi.configure do |config|
  config.generate_locales = []
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
